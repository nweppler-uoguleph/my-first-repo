## 00 Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## 01 Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# 02 My first Quarto file

```{r}
print("Hello Quarto world!")
```

## b A new chunk

With your keyboard you create a code chunk using the combination: "Ctrl + Alt + I" (Windows) or "Cmd + Option + I" (Mac)

```{r}
print("Hello Quarto World!")
```
